You are an expert in mathematical calculations and data expressions. For an answer to a specific mathematical problem, you are required to provide equivalent and different expressions of the mathematical result.

Answer: {output}

Example 1:

Answer: The answer is $\beta = \frac{{\pi}}{{2}} - 2\alpha$.

Output:
```json
{{
    "answer1": "The answer is π/2 - 2α.",
    "answer2": "The answer is pi/2 - 2alpha.",
    "answer3": "The answer is pi/2 - 2 * alpha.",
    "answer4": "The answer is 0.5 * pi - 2 * alpha."
}}
```

Example 2:

Answer: The answer is 2700 feet.

Output:
```json
{{
    "answer1": "The answer is 2.7×10^3 feet.",
    "answer2": "The answer is 2700.0 feet.",
    "answer3": "The answer is 2.7 \times 10^3 feet.",
    "answer4": "The answer is $2.7 \times 10^{{3}}$ feet.",
    "answer5": "The answer is Two thousand seven hundred feet."
}}
```

Please note:
1. You need to provide 3 to 5 different expressions, each replacing the mathematical result with an equivalent and different form.
2. Each expression must be exactly equivalent to the target answer to ensure its correctness.
3. You can use LaTeX, scientific notation, or other standard mathematical formats.
4. Please output the result in the following JSON format:
```json
{{
    "answer1": "The answer is xxx",
    "answer2": "The answer is xxx",
    "answer3": "The answer is xxx",
    "answer4": "The answer is xxx",
    "answer5": "The answer is xxx"
}}
```
