## 📘 介绍

xVerify 是一款基于预训练大语言模型微调而来的评估工具，专为具有唯一正确答案的客观题设计。它能从超长推理过程中精准提取最终答案，并通过智能等价性比较，高效识别不同形式的数学表达、LaTeX 与字符串表达及自然语言描述之间的等价关系。无论是数学题、选择题、分类题还是简答题，xVerify 都能提供精准、灵活的答案评估，极大提升评测效率和准确性。

## 🌟 主要特点
- 广泛的适用性：适用于各种不同的客观题评估场景。
    - 支持多种题型：数学题、多选题、分类题、简答题。
    - 支持超长推理：可以有效处理包含超长推理链的回答，识别超长推理中的最终答案。
    - 支持多种语言：主要支持中英文回答，并兼容其他语言。
- 强大的等价性判断：有效识别各类表达形式不同的等价表述。
    - 简单的答案转换识别：字母选项（a -> A）、希腊字母（alpha -> α）等
    - 多种数学表达形式的等价性判断：LaTex 格式（\frac{4}{5} -> 4/5）、科学计数法（1.34 x 10^3 -> 13400）、自然语言形式（one hundred and twenty-three -> 123）等，并且针对有缺失或者不同形式的 LaTex 格式也能正确处理。
    - 自然语言的等价性判断：针对简答题，可以有效识别 LLM 回答语句是否与正确答案的内容对齐。
    - 针对选择题，xVerify 可准确识别 LLM 回答中的选项内容或编号，而不仅限于匹配正确答案的编号。例如，若 LLM 仅提及正确选项的内容而未提供编号，xVerify 仍能对其进行匹配并判断正确性。
- 多规格模型可选：提供多个不同规格、不同基座的 xVerify 模型，规避基座模型的偏见。
    - 提供多个不同参数规模的 xVerify 模型，涵盖 0.5B 到 32B，可以基于可用计算资源灵活选择。
    - 提供多个不同基座模型微调而来的 xVerify 模型，包括 Qwen 2.5、Gemma 2、LLaMA 3.1、LLaMA 3.2、GLM 4、Phi-4 系列模型，可以基于需要评估的模型灵活选择，规避模型偏见。

##  🧪 评估示例
我们展示了一些具有代表性的示例：
- 具有复杂表达式的数学题示例：下面 4 个示例中 LLM 回答均包含较长的推理过程，设计复杂的数学计算与推理，最终答案的表达式也比较困难。此外，示例中 LLM 回答和正确答案中数学表达式所使用的形式不一致，例如前三个示例中，最终答案的表达式比较复杂，并且 LLM 回答中所使用表达形式与正确答案不一致，第 4 个示例中最终答案使用自然语言的形式，基于 RegEx 的方法在这里将完全失效。

    "question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\nLet $n=\\operatorname{pop}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)$. In terms of $n$, compute $d$.",
    "correct_answer": "(1 + (1 + 8n)^(1/2)) / 2",
    "llm_output": "To find the number of dishes $d$ in terms of the population $n$ of a full town $\mathcal{F}_{d}$, we need to understand how the residents of the town can make pairs of dishes.\n\nSince each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes, and no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes, we can think of each resident as a unique pair of dishes.\n\nIn a full town, for every pair of dishes in $\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. This means that each pair of dishes corresponds to exactly one resident.\n\nTherefore, the number of pairs of dishes is equal to the number of residents. The number of pairs of dishes can be calculated using the combination formula: $\binom{d}{2} = \frac{d(d-1)}{2}$.\n\nSince each resident corresponds to a unique pair of dishes, the number of residents is equal to the number of pairs of dishes: $n = \frac{d(d-1)}{2}$.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $d$: $d^2 - d - 2n = 0$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can solve for $d$: $d = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2}$.\n\nSince $d$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive root: $d = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2}$.",

    "question": "Consider an $m$-by-$n$ grid of unit squares, indexed by $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq m$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq n$. There are $(m-1)(n-1)$ coins, which are initially placed in the squares $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq m-1$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq n-1$. If a coin occupies the square $(i,j)$ with $i \\leq m-1$ and $j \\leq n-1$ and the squares $(i+1,j), (i,j+1)$, and $(i+1,j+1)$ are unoccupied, then a legal move is to slide the coin from $(i,j)$ to $(i+1,j+1)$. How many distinct configurations of coins can be reached starting from the initial configuration by a (possibly empty) sequence of legal moves?",
    "correct_answer": "$\\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}$",
    "llm_output": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a grid where coins can move diagonally to empty spaces. The key is to realize that the coins effectively \"fill\" the grid in a specific way.  \n\n**Key Observation**\n\n*  A coin can only move to an empty square diagonally adjacent to it.\n*  Once a coin is placed in a square, it cannot move back to its original position.\n\n**Solution Approach**\n\n1. **Final State:**  Think about the final possible configurations.  The coins will end up in a specific set of squares.  \n\n2. **Constraints:**  The constraints on the moves dictate that the coins will always form a pattern where they occupy the squares along a diagonal.\n\n3. **Counting Configurations:**  The number of distinct configurations is determined by the number of ways to choose which squares along the diagonal will be occupied by coins.\n\n**Formalizing the Counting**\n\nLet's represent the grid with a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 1 represents a coin and 0 represents an empty square.  Since the coins always move diagonally, the sequence will have a specific pattern.  \n\nFor example, if  *m* = 4 and *n* = 4, the initial configuration would be:\n\n```\n1111\n1000\n1000\n1000\n```\n\nAnd a possible final configuration could be:\n\n```\n1010\n0101\n0000\n0000\n```\n\nNotice that the final configuration has a diagonal pattern of 1s.  The number of distinct configurations is determined by the number of ways to choose the positions of the 1s in this diagonal pattern.\n\n\n**The answer is <(m-1)(n-1)>.** \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of why this is the case!",

It started out with an explosion of character involvement and then the fire went out. She failed to give the reader a true insight into the main characters. I was hard pressed to understand why the two main characters were attracted to each other. I could only assume it was because they were trying to save a small company.

The reviewer states that it was \"hard to believe\" that the novel was written by JAK, implying that they were disappointed with the quality of the book.\n2. They mention that the prologue was the best part of the book, but this is a negative statement because it implies that the rest of the book was not as good.\n3. The reviewer criticizes the author for failing to give the reader a true insight into the main characters and for not making the characters' attraction to each other believable.\n4. They also mention that the secondary characters were not well-developed, which is another negative point.\n5. The reviewer states that they read the book in one weekend, but this is not a positive statement because it implies that they were trying to finish the book quickly rather than enjoying it.\n6.

## 📊 实验结果
我们收集了目前常用于评估 LLM 回答正确性的评估框架和 judge model，并在四类客观题（字母选择题、数学题、简答题、分类题）上与 xVerify 进行了对比评估。其中，测试集中的样本与 xVerify 的训练集分布相同，即来自同一批的 LLM 在同一批评估集（客观题）上生成的回答，而泛化集则是采用不同的评估集询问 LLM 来生成样本，并且新增了多个新的 LLM 进行回答来生成样本，所以泛化集中的样本分布与训练集和测试集存在显著差异，其涵盖范围也更加广泛，可以有效检验 xVerify 的泛化性。
下表展示了测试集和泛化集上所有评估结果，"-" 表示评估方法在该类问题上不适用，每列最优值将被加粗，每列次优值将被标记下划线。
