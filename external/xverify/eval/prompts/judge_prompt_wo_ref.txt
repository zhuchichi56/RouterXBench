Special considerations:

1. **Multiple Answers**: If the output contains multiple answers, evaluate whether later answers modify or correct earlier ones. In such cases, compare the final answer with the correct answer. If the final answer is unclear or incorrect, respond with [Incorrect].

2. **Mathematical Equivalence**: **Mathematical Problems**: If the formats differ but the answers are mathematically equivalent, respond with [Correct].

3. **Open-Ended Responses**: For correct answers stated in natural language, the output must align with the correct answer in content and meaning to be considered [Correct].
